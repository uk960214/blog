# Problem
## Create a program that uses Luhn's Algorithm to identify if the input number is a valid credit card number for AMEX, MASTERCARD, and VISA.

<br>

# Breaking Down the Problem

## Basic Characteristics of Credit Card Numbers

> <br>
> 1. The numbers have specific **digits** (AMEX: 15, MASTER: 16, VISA: 13 or 16 ) <br>
> 2. The **first two digits** of the number are also specific (AMEX: 34 or 37, MASTER: 51~55, VISA: 40~49) <br> 
> <br>

<br>

## Luhn's Algorithm
Not only does the number have to fit the requirements above, it also needs to be validated through Luhn's Algorithm which is as follows:

> <br>
> Step 1. Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.
> Step 2. Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.
> If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid. <br>
> <br>

<br>

# My Solution
## Logical Steps

> <br> Get input Number from User (only receive valid integers) > Copy the Card Number twice to perform loops for Step 1 and 2 > Loop Step 1 > Loop Step 2 > Calculate digit of number > Check if it passes all requirements > Use switch/case to identify which card <br>
> <br>

## 1. Receive input
Receive input long integers from user using get_long from cs50.h library. Only allow positive integers.

``` C
long card_no;
    do
    {
        card_no = get_long("Number: ");
    }
    while (card_no < 1);
```

## 2. Initiate Copy of the Card Numbers
I copied the card number twice, so that even though I use these numbers to run the Algorithm, the original card number stays unchanged, which will be used later on to find out the first two digits.

``` C
long copy_for_step_1 = card_no / 10;
long copy_for_step_2 = card_no;
```

The first copy is divided by 10, because the initial value that we are trying to get is the second to last number of the whole number.

## 3. Checksum Step 1
In order to find out every other digit starting from the second to last value, I used `modulo 10, which will provide me with the value of one's digit`. And then I `multiplied each value by 2`, and checked if it was a two digit or one digit number. If it was a `single digit, the number was simply added to the sum`. If it was a `two digit number, I added the value divided by 10 and modulo 10`, so that the value of both one's digit and ten's digit could be added to the sum. To proceed the loop, I `divided the copied card number by 10`, moving to two digits forwards. The Loop ended when the copied number was a single digit.

``` C
long sum = 0;
do
{
    long num =  copy_for_step_1 % 10;
    long timesTwo = num * 2;
    if (timesTwo > 9)
    {
        sum += (timesTwo / 10) + (timesTwo % 10);
    }
    else
    {
        sum += timesTwo;
    }
    copy_for_step_1 /= 100;
}
while (copy_for_step_1 > 1);
```


## 4. Checksum Step 2
Using the same pattern as step 1, this time, I just added every other value starting from the very end.

``` C
do
{
    long num =  copy_for_step_2 % 10;
    sum += num;
    copy_for_step_2 /= 100;
}
while (copy_for_step_2 > 1);
```

## 5. Getting the Length of the Number
In order to get the digit of the number to find out if the digits were 13, 15, or 16, I looped through the number, dividing by 10 and counting a digit in every loop.
``` C
int digits = 1;
long copy_for_dig = card_no;
while (copy_for_dig > 10)
{
    digits ++;
    copy_for_dig /= 10;
}
```
## 6. Finding out the First Two Digits of the number
Using the same logic as above, I stopped the loop when the value was below hundred, to find the very first two digits of the number.

``` C
long first_two_digits = card_no;
while (first_two_digits > 100)
{
    first_two_digits /= 10;
};
```

## 7. Final Validation
`If the sum calculated in Step 4 modulo 10 is 0:` Check Length of Number > Check First Two Digits > Print the Corresponding Card Name

`If the sum calculated in Step 4 modulo 10 is NOT 0:` > Print Invalid

`If the length of the number isn't 13, 15, or 16:` > Print Invalid

`If the first two digits doesn't match any of the criteria:` > Print Invalid
``` C
if (sum % 10 == 0)
{
    // Check digit of input
    switch (digits)
    {
        // Check for VISA with 13 digits
        case 13:
            if (first_two_digits > 39 && first_two_digits < 50)
            {
                printf("VISA\n");
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                printf("INVALID\n");
                break;
            }
        // Check for AMEX with 15 digits
        case 15:
            if (first_two_digits == 34 || first_two_digits == 37)
            {
                printf("AMEX\n");
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                printf("INVALID\n");
                break;
            }
        // Check for VISA or MASTERCARD with 16 digits
        case 16:
            if (first_two_digits > 39 && first_two_digits < 50)
            {
                printf("VISA\n");
                break;
            }
            if (first_two_digits > 50 && first_two_digits < 56)
            {
                printf("MASTERCARD\n");
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                printf("INVALID\n");
                break;
            }
        // If the digits aren't 13, 15, or 16, print invalid
        default:
            printf("INVALID\n");
    }
}
// If the sum's modulo 10 isn't congruent to 0, print invalid
else
{
    printf("INVALID\n");
}
```
