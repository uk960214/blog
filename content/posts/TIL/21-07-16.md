For auto increment id on Google Sheets - Stack Overflow [Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66968405/auto-increment-id-number-google-apps-script)

# Motivation
For my react app, I wanted to create a page where I could ask for the user's email and name, maybe for future marketing purposes. Although storing these kind of data would conventionally require a backend server and a database connected to it. However, I wanted this project to be as lightweight as possible, preferably a Front End only project. Therefore, in search for a way to simply connect this app to a database API of sorts. The solution I found was Google Sheets and the Apps Script API.

# Process
Google Sheets provides a automated access to the sheets using Apps Script, which works as a form of backend that could be used to read and write to rows in the sheet with data from outer source. When deployed, a url is created that can receive request and parse that information. Thus, when my react app sends a request of JSON to this url, Apps Script can parse this data and write it to Google sheets.

## Setting Up Google Sheets and Apps Script
In my sheet I created three columns, where each would contain the primary key, name, and email. In the Apps Script of this sheet, I created a function that receives a JSON data, parses the body, and when there is valid name and email, this is written into the sheet database.

For the auto incrementing id number, I used the code found on stack overflow on this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66968405/auto-increment-id-number-google-apps-script).

```JS
function getNextId() {
  // Get properties
  const properties = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties()

  // Aquire the script lock. Prevents race condition
  const lock = LockService.getScriptLock()
  lock.waitLock(2000)

  // Get the saved ID and save the next value
  // Properties are string so it has to convert the type
  const id = parseInt(properties.getProperty('id_seq') || 0)
  properties.setProperty('id_seq', (id+1).toString())

  // Release the script lock (allows other executions to continue)
  lock.releaseLock()

  // Return the result
  console.log(id)
  return id
}

function doPost(e) {
  // Get next ID number  
  const id = getNextId();

  // Get the target google sheet
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const ws = ss.getSheetByName('test');

  // Parse JSON data from request
  const body = e.postData.contents;
  const bodyJson = JSON.parse(body);

  // If body data is valid, write row to database
  if(bodyJson.name && bodyJson.email) {
    ws.appendRow([id, bodyJson.name, bodyJson.email]);
  }
}
```


## Deploy app on App Scripts
Using the graphical interface of Apps Script, deploy the "doPost" App, with options selected for web app, verifying with me, and access to everyone.


## Write function on react app that fetches request

``` JSX
onSendButton = (event) => {
    // Prevents from sending get request (- not sure why)
    event.preventDefault()

    // Validate Email & Name Input
    if(this.validateInput()) {
        const url = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_APP_URL';
        fetch(url, {
            method: 'post',
            mode: 'no-cors',
            headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
            body: JSON.stringify({
                // Input data is stored as state on the react app
                name: this.state.name,
                email: this.state.email,
            })
            // After sending data, change route
        }).then(() => {this.props.onRouteChange('result')}) 
    }
}
```
